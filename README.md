# MtaCoin

The MtaCoin project aims to practice synchronization between consumer and producer threads within the same process. It involves executing a multithreaded application that simulates a cryptocurrency blockchain network. This network consists of four mining threads that mine blocks (calculate hashes) and send these blocks to a server. The server then verifies and adds these blocks to its blockchain.
